# URL-Shortener-Web-app.
This repository is an assignment project of a URL hashing system using Django.
Basically it works as a URL shortening web app.
## Tools
### Backend
1. Python - Django
2. Django REST framework
3. PostgreSQL
Other libaries are specified with versions in requirements.txt file.

I chose Python for the versatality of syntax and my familiarity with it.
- And Django because it is super fast, Works on MVT (Model View Architecture) which is scalable and easily maintainable.
- Django offers a lot of built-in features like Auth Models which I have used for Authentication.
- Another best features is I dont need to revise SQL beacure I dont have to write any SQL querries with django.
- I chose REST framework for similar reasons but honestly I am not familiar with it  a lot.
- I chose PostgreSQL database because it is the most compatible with Django and the instance is very useful to setup with railway

### Frontend
#### TailwindCSS
I used Flowbites prebuild code from their website
